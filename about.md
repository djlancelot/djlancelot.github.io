My name is László Velinszky. 

I had my first PC at the age of 6 and tried to create new things using that ever since.
I started out with creating EXE files in a Norton Commander editor, which didn't really
 work out at the time but slowly moved on to creating my first website by the age of 14.

I've worked with computers ever since. Always trying to catch up with the latest 
technologies.
