Hi, my name is László Velinszky. 

I had my first PC at the age of 6 and tried create things with computers ever since.

I started out by creating EXE files in a Norton Commander editor, which didn't really
 work out at the time but slowly moved on to creating my first website by the age of 14.

Some time has passed ever since but the desire to create things and to stay on top of cutting edge technology is still keeping me going from day to day.
