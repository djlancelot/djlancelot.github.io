Hi, my name is László Velinszky. 

I had my first PC at the age of 6 and tried to create new things using that ever since.
I started out with creating EXE files in a Norton Commander editor, which didn't really
 work out at the time but slowly moved on to creating my first website by the age of 14.

Some time has passed ever since but the desire to create things and stay on top with
cutting edge technology is still keeping me going from day to day.
